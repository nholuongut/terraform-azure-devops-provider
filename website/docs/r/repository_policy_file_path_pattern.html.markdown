  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
  visibility         = "private"
  version_control    = "Git"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
}

resource "azuredevops_git_repository" "r" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.p.id
  name       = "Sample Repo"
  initialization {
    init_type = "Clean"
  }
}

resource "azuredevops_repository_policy_file_path_pattern" "p" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.p.id

  enabled           = true
  blocking          = true
  filepath_patterns = ["*.go", "/home/test/*.ts"]
  repository_ids    = [azuredevops_git_repository.r.id]
}
```

# Set project level repository policy
```hcl
resource "azuredevops_repository_policy_file_path_pattern" "p" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.p.id
  enabled  = true
  blocking = true
  filepath_patterns = ["*.go", "/home/test/*.ts"]
}
```
