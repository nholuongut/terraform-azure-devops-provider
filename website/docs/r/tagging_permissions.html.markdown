# azuredevops_tagging_permissions

Manages permissions for tagging

## Permission levels

Permissions for tagging within Azure DevOps can be applied only on Organizational and Project level.
The project level is reflected by specifying the argument `project_id`, otherwise the permissions are set on the organizational level.

## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "azuredevops_project" "project" {
  name               = "Sample Project"
  work_item_template = "Agile"
  version_control    = "Git"
  visibility         = "private"
  description        = "Managed by Terraform"
}

data "azuredevops_group" "project-readers" {
  project_id = azuredevops_project.project.id
  name       = "Readers"
}

resource "azuredevops_tagging_permissions" "root-permissions" {
  project_id  = azuredevops_project.project.id
  principal   = data.azuredevops_group.project-readers.id
  permissions = {
    Enumerate    = "allow"
    Create       = "allow"
    Update       = "allow"
    Delete       = "allow"
  }
}
```
